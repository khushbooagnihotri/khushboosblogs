      <p>No matter what you use as your browser, it could be Chrome, 
        Safari, or Firefox. One purpose they all have is to render your files such as your 
        HTML, CSS, or your JavaScript files into a website that is to be displayed</p>

      <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. There are many markup 
        languages such as XML, GML, etc. All these languages are called markup languages
         because they’re based on the concept of markups that are used by editors when they
          mark up the manuscripts to either specify changes to the author or specify structure 
          and layout to the publishers. For example, 
        underlining a word represents it should be printed in italics.</p>

      <p>HTML5 is one of the latest web technologies that are mostly being used in the web industry. 
        Few features that make HTML5 different from other alternatives and
         so popular among web developers are:</p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">1. Local Storage in HTML5</h2>
      <p>
        The HTML5 has local Storage which means that the object stores the data with no 
        expiration date and so your work will be available to you even after you refresh or 
        close your browser. This feature depends on your browser. It will work on Chrome 4.0, 
        Internet Explorer/Edge 8.0, Firefox 3.5, Safari 4.0, and Opera 11.5 or their later versions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">2. New Doctype</h2>
      <p>
        In HTML5, you get a new doctype which helps you stay up to date! doctype is 
        the first necessity in an HTML5 document, so in HTML5 doctype is written as <!doctype html>. 
        HTML5 is
SGML based unlike HTML4.01 or XHTML1. If you don’t use doctype at the beginning of your HTML5 file 
your page will not load up like the structure you wanted.

      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">3. Required Attribute</h2>
      <p>
        With HTML5, forms now have a new required attribute that can automatically check whether 
        a specific input field is needed or not. This saves us the effort to write the code for 
        validation of the form.<input name="First" required="" type="text" /> or <input name="First" required="required" type="text" />
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle">4. New Multimedia Support in HTML5</h2>
