      <img src="images/blog2.png" alt="blog1" class="blog-img" />
      <p>
        At the end of my freshman year, I got an email regarding the interviews 
        for being a DSC Core Team Member in my college, G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering.
         Many people were interviewed, but only five people were selected and I was one of them!
      </p>

      <p>Google Developer Student Clubs are community groups for college and university students interested 
        in Google developer technologies. Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an 
        interest in growing as a developer can join DSC. By joining a DSC, students can grow their knowledge 
        in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build solutions for local businesses and 
        their communities. Developers Student Clubs is one of the Developer Community programs powered by
         Google Developers. It 
        was launched in India in 2017 and DSC’s are now in 68+ countries with 860+ groups.</p>

      <p>As a core team member, I helped in organizing many events and workshops like 30 Days of 
        Google Cloud, Hands-on sessions on UI & UX, and also collaborated with 
        other DSC’s in DSC WOW.

      <p>
        I like to challenge myself and explore new opportunities so when the applications for GDSC Leads
         opened in April this year, I did not waste any time and jumped on this opportunity. The former 
         Lead of my club was supportive and guided me through the whole process. I was suggested to apply
          as soon as I could and be careful while doing so. 

      </p>

      <p>
        The application consisted of a few sections, after filling in the basic details three community
         questions were compulsory, and at last a recorded video of the applicant not longer than 2 
         minutes, describing who you are and why you should become a Lead.
         I made sure that all my answers were personalized and were nearly the same word count as specified. 
         You can also get a senior or a family member to review your answers and check them once for grammar And
          plagiarism issues too. My previous Lead, Shreyas Malewar also provided me with a 
          referral for my application.
      </p>

      <p>
        After applying, I received an email in May, informing me to schedule a video call with a 
        representative for the further selection process. I chose a time slot I was comfortable with 
        and gave the interview a week later. The call went on for about 30 minutes, and though I was 
        a bit nervous, the interviewer made sure I was comfortable before we started. The questions 
        mainly revolved around why I should be the Lead and who I am as an individual. Since I was a 
        core team member before, I was asked about my experience and my role in the team. Make sure to 
        highlight your contributions and skills, I didn’t shy away from flaunting a blog program that I
         initiated and managed as an editor in DSC GHRCE, mentioned a project I was working on and the 
         technologies I used for it, and also mention your past leadership experiences like I was the 
         student council president in my first year and had a good experience in organizing events. 

      </p>

      <p>
        My interview went well but still, I had some doubts as I thought that I could have said 
        something different, but when I received 
        my selection email on a random Thursday afternoon in July, I was ecstatic and relieved.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m excited to begin a new chapter as the GDSC lead 
        of my campus and impact more students as I move ahead!
      </p>
