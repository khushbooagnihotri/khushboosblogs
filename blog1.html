      <p>Blogging is a vast topic; it comes in a variety of forms. 
        From food to books, and soft skills tips to the latest buzzing technologies, 
        people blog about everything. It’s said that the first blog to be published was Links.net, 
        created in 1994 by Justin Hall, as a place to publish his writing. 
        The site consisted entirely of brief posts, each sharing a link and a few of his thoughts 
        on the content within. Since then, blogging has come a long way. 
        Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, 
        but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses, improving personal 
        portfolio’s and even for documentation purposes.</p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> When it comes to students and developers, blogging can 
        be an excellent tool for improving one’s contribution and most importantly, writing skills.</h2>
      <p>
        There are many benefits of blogging. We develop much-improved writing skills that stick with us forever. Our thinking muscles will be in 
        continuous development, and we can also develop a better understanding of the world that surrounds us.
      </p>
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle"> There are many reasons why I think that everyone should give a try to blogging.</h2>
